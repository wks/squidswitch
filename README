SquidSwitch - a toy to bring up or bring down the Squid proxy service
Author: Kunshan Wang <wks1986@gmail.com>

My family use one 3g wireless modem for Internet access.  The typical use
case is to plug the modem on my laptop and other machines at home connect
to my Squid proxy server via Wifi.

Since I usually carry my laptop around, the Squid server should not be
always on for security reason.  But I am also tired of typing
'systemctl start squid.service' again and again.  So I added an system
status icon to the GnomeShell panel so as to quickly switch Squid on or off.

This extension is tested on Fedora 15.

In order to use it, you must configure your /etc/dbus-1/system.d/org.freedesktop.systemd1.conf

Add these lines to allow normal user to control the squid service.

<policy user="your username here">
  <allow send_destination="org.freedesktop.systemd1"
         send_path="/org/freedesktop/systemd1/unit/squid_2eservice"
         />
  
  <allow receive_sender="org.freedesktop.systemd1"
         receive_path="/org/freedesktop/systemd1/unit/squid_2eservice"
         />
</policy>

Then put the squidswitch@wks.github.com folder into ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions and enjoy it!
